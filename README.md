# **DEEP LEARN AND COMPUTER VISION**

Welcome to my journey learning this area :satisfied:

## Important stuff:

### Before we start:
For this project, the *datatreatment* folder will have the code needed for image preprocessing as well as the dataset.  
To get those scripts working, we need to install that folder as a package.

In each virtual environment:

```bash
cd RepoName   # idk what the repo name will be
pip install -e .
```

> NOTE: I'm not an expert in Python; I ran these commands before writing the scripts.  
> I’m not sure if running them *inside* the scripts would cause any issues.

### Naming of folders:
I don’t like having general use folders after each section’s folders lmao, so by putting `Z_01` at the top I guarantee that if they’re sorted alphabetically, they’ll stay at the end.

Maybe is not the best looking option

### Language:
Sorry but i interchange :us: :es: and :brazil:
